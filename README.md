### Step 1: Generating Sentence Embeddings with Sentence Transformers

This script demonstrates how to generate sentence embeddings using the SentenceTransformers library. The goal is to encode text data into embeddings, which are numerical representations of sentences. These embeddings are useful for tasks like semantic similarity and clustering.

### Step 2: Visualizing Sentence Embeddings with DataMapPlot

Once the sentence embeddings are generated, the next step is to visualize them. This script utilizes DataMapPlot to create an interactive plot, showing how the embeddings are clustered and organized in a 2D space.

The visualization helps in understanding the structure of the data and identifying patterns or clusters of sentences that share semantic similarities.
